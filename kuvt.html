	<h1>Kutztown University Virtual Tour</h1>
	<p>The KUAR ( Kutztown University Augmented Reality ) application 
	is an Android app build from the ground up by a team of three 
	computer science students at Kutztown University, with the help of 
	two communication design students. This Android application is designed 
	to allow a prospective student to tour the campus and retrieve information 
	about the various buildings on the academic portion of the Kutztown campus.
	The app has two main functions, the first being an augmented reality view 
	through an Android device. When the device's camera is aimed at an academic 
	building, information will appear onscreen. The second function is an 
	interactive map of campus, where buildings can be selected and information 
	displayed. The user's location is also displayed on the map so they can 
	effectively complete a self guided tour of campus.</p>
